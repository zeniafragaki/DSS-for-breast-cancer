# DSS for discrimination of benign from malignant cases.

Part of university project for decision supporting systens lesson.

This project aims to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) that assists in the classification of medical imaging data (specifically MRI images) into benign and malignant categories.
The system utilizes machine learning models to analyze image features and accurately predict whether a given case is benign or malignant.

Features


Data Preprocessing: The system preprocesses MRI images, extracting relevant features and preparing them for model training.

Model Selection: Multiple machine learning models are evaluated, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.


Performance Metrics: The system evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports, providing detailed insights into the system's effectiveness.


Visualization: Graphs and heatmaps are provided to visualize model performance and confusion matrices for better interpretability.
