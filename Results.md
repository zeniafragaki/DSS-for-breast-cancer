# Results 

From these results, we observe that SVM appears to be the most balanced model, offering relatively high accuracy and cross-validation accuracy, indicating both good performance and generalization. Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN show significant signs of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.
