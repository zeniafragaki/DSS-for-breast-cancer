# Results 

From these results, we observe that SVM appears to be the most balanced model, offering relatively high accuracy and cross-validation accuracy, indicating both good performance and generalization. Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN show significant signs of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

Model	Accuracy	Cross Validation Accuracy


Random Forest     	56.6%	        56.7%


SVM	                62.5%       	66.7%


KNN	                62.5%       	56.6%


Logistic Regression	37.5%       	38.3%


Decision Tree	      75%	          50%
