# Results 

From these results, we observe that SVM appears to be the most balanced model, offering relatively high accuracy and cross-validation accuracy, indicating both good performance and generalization. Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN show significant signs of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

4. DISCUSSION


As it highlighted before, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, 
and Decision Tree achieved higher accuracy than cross validation 
accuracy scores, indicating that it could be an overfitting problem. 
According SVM and KNN despite the low accuracies they have 
achieved higher cross validation accuracies suggesting they could 
possibly generalize better with further processing and tuning. 


6. CONCLUSION

   
In conclusion, the project demonstrates the potential of machine 
learning techniques in classifying medical images for benign and 
malignant detection. Random Forest algorithm appears to have 
the most balanced combination between accuracy and cross 
validation accuracy. This project was done under specific one 
circumstances for an undergraduate student project facing 
problems as lack of bigger amount of data, some time-consuming 
restrictions and not significant computational power. Although, 
seems to have some understandable and reasonable results. Future 
work on the study is important to overcome the obstacles of 
overfitting, suggesting starting the research from Random Forest 
as it has shown quite well performance the entire duration of the 
research with no significant ups and downs as the other models.
